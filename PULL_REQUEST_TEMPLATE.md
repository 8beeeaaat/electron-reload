# A quick note for PRs
  * PRs are strictly limited to technical changes to the source code (e.g., please no PRs for changes to the documentation)
  * Before submitting a PR, please consult the issues, if you don't find a matching issue, open a new one and let's discuss the changes first
  * *Always* refer to the corresponding issue addressed by your PR in the last commit (e.g., `fixes #12`)
